# Rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms: 

## A synthesizing analysis of observational, experimental and medical research



</br></br>

# Overview

All analyses were performed in R. The complete analytical pipeline used to run the analyses is included in the script
[analysis.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/litSearch.R).


</br>

## Analytical scripts

The following analytical scripts are available:

1) [functions.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/functions.R): Script including all derived functions used to perform the analyses
2) [litSearch.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/litSearch.R): Script to conduct the systematic literature research in R 
3) [runMeta.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/runMeta.R): Script to process the extracted [data](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/tree/main/data) and perform meta-analyses on rates and predictors of CAPS
4) [createTable.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/createTable.R): Script to generate [supplementary tables](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/tree/main/results/tables/)
